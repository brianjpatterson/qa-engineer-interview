Interview Questions and Answers for Software Testing / SDET / QA automation engineer


# How do you approach working in an ambiguous environment?


Understand the scope of the project and its objectives: I would first try to understand the high-level goals of the project and what the end-result is supposed to be. This would help me get a sense of what needs to be achieved and what the expectations are.


Gather requirements: I would then work on gathering as much information as possible about the project. I would reach out to stakeholders, developers, and other team members to understand the requirements, constraints, and any other factors that could impact the project.


Identify key areas of uncertainty: Once I have a good understanding of the project, I would try to identify the key areas where there is ambiguity or uncertainty. This could include things like requirements that are not fully defined, unclear acceptance criteria, or areas of the application that are yet to be built.


Prioritize testing efforts: I would then prioritize my testing efforts based on the areas of uncertainty. I would focus on testing the most critical and uncertain parts of the application first.


Communicate and collaborate with team members: In an ambiguous environment, communication and collaboration are key. I would make sure that I am regularly communicating with the other members of the team and working with them to resolve any issues or questions that arise.


Be adaptable and flexible: I would be prepared to adapt my approach as more information becomes available, and be open to changing my testing strategy as needed.


Document and keep track of the progress: I would document my testing efforts and track my progress to ensure that I am on track to meet the project's objectives. This would help me identify any issues that need to be addressed and ensure that the project is moving in the right direction.


Communicate with stakeholders: I would keep stakeholders informed of the progress of the project, and any issues or risks that arise. This would help ensure that stakeholders are aware of what is happening and that they are able to make informed decisions.


# What is your approach to selecting elements in Selenium?


Inspect the element: I would first inspect the element on the web page using browser developer tools to obtain the unique properties of the element such as the id, class, name, or xpath.


Choose the best locator strategy: I would then choose the most appropriate locator strategy based on the unique properties of the element, the stability of the locator, and the performance of the test.


Use the most stable and unique locator: I would prefer using the id or name attribute as a locator if they are unique and stable.


Use class or CSS selectors with caution: I would use class or CSS selectors with caution as they can be affected by changes in the web page's layout.


Use xpath only if necessary: I would use xpath only if no other locator strategy works and if the element is not present in the HTML DOM.


Avoid using the index: I would avoid using the index when selecting elements as it can lead to flaky tests and unexpected results.


Use explicit waits: I would use explicit waits to ensure that the elements are loaded and available before interacting with them.


Avoid hardcoding the locators: I would avoid hardcoding the locators in the test scripts and instead store them in a separate file or class to make the test more maintainable.


Validate the selected element: I would validate that the selected element is indeed the correct one by interacting with it or checking its properties.


In summary, my approach would be to select elements by using the most stable and unique locator, avoiding hardcoding the locators, validating the selected elements and using explicit waits when necessary. This approach would help ensure that the tests are reliable, maintainable and efficient.
