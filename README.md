Interview Questions and Answers for Software Testing / SDET / QA automation engineer


# What is your approach when you have found a bug in the software product?


Reproduce the bug: I would first reproduce the bug to ensure that it can be consistently replicated and to gather any additional information that may be needed to understand the bug.


Document the bug: I would then document the bug in a clear and concise manner, including information such as the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. I would also include any relevant screenshots, log files, or error messages.


Assess the severity of the bug: I would assess the severity of the bug and determine the priority level based on how it impacts the functionality of the software. This would help to determine when the bug should be fixed and how it should be prioritized.


Communicate the bug to the development team: I would communicate the bug to the development team as soon as possible, providing them with all of the relevant information and documentation. This would help them understand the issue and begin working on a fix.


Track the bug: I would track the bug throughout the entire process, from the initial report to the final resolution. This would involve keeping track of the status, progress, and any additional information that may be needed to resolve the bug.


Validate the bug fix: Once the development team has fixed the bug, I would validate the bug fix to ensure that it has been resolved and that the software is functioning as expected.


Update the documentation: If necessary, I would update the documentation to reflect the bug and its resolution.


Communicate the resolution to the stakeholders: I would communicate the resolution of the bug to the stakeholders, including the development team, the project manager, and any other relevant parties.


Overall, my approach would be to ensure that the bug is thoroughly documented, communicated promptly, and tracked until it is resolved and validated. I will also make sure that the stakeholders are informed about the bug resolution and the impact it has on the software.



# What are different qualities that a software QA engineer should have in order for them to be successful in a very fast moving environment?


Strong attention to detail: They should be able to spot even the smallest bugs or errors in the software.


Good communication skills: They should be able to clearly communicate any issues or concerns to the development team.


Flexibility and adaptability: They should be able to adjust to changes in requirements or timelines quickly and efficiently.


Strong problem-solving skills: They should be able to think critically and come up with effective solutions to any problems that arise.


Technical expertise: They should have a good understanding of the software development process and be familiar with industry-standard tools and technologies.


Proactivity and initiative: They should be able to identify and address potential issues before they become problems.


Strong team player: They should be able to work well with other team members and collaborate effectively to deliver high-quality software.



# Can you tell me the difference between an implicit and explicit wait?


In software QA engineering, an implicit wait and an explicit wait are both used to handle dynamic elements on a web page, but they differ in how they are implemented and used.


An implicit wait is a setting that is applied globally to the entire WebDriver instance. When an implicit wait is set, the WebDriver will wait for a certain amount of time (in seconds) before timing out when trying to find an element on the page. This wait time applies to all elements, and will be used whenever the WebDriver is searching for an element. The implicit wait is set once and lasts for the entire duration of the WebDriver's execution.


On the other hand, an explicit wait is used to wait for a specific element or condition to be met before proceeding with the execution of the script. The explicit wait is set on a per-element basis and is used in conjunction with expected conditions, which are predefined conditions that the WebDriver should wait for before proceeding. The explicit wait is set only when the specific element or condition is needed, and will only wait for that specific element or condition.


In general, an implicit wait is used when you expect an element to be present within a certain amount of time and an explicit wait is used when you want to wait for a specific element or condition on the page before proceeding with the execution of the script.



# How do you approach working in an ambiguous environment?


Understand the scope of the project and its objectives: I would first try to understand the high-level goals of the project and what the end-result is supposed to be. This would help me get a sense of what needs to be achieved and what the expectations are.


Gather requirements: I would then work on gathering as much information as possible about the project. I would reach out to stakeholders, developers, and other team members to understand the requirements, constraints, and any other factors that could impact the project.


Identify key areas of uncertainty: Once I have a good understanding of the project, I would try to identify the key areas where there is ambiguity or uncertainty. This could include things like requirements that are not fully defined, unclear acceptance criteria, or areas of the application that are yet to be built.


Prioritize testing efforts: I would then prioritize my testing efforts based on the areas of uncertainty. I would focus on testing the most critical and uncertain parts of the application first.


Communicate and collaborate with team members: In an ambiguous environment, communication and collaboration are key. I would make sure that I am regularly communicating with the other members of the team and working with them to resolve any issues or questions that arise.


Be adaptable and flexible: I would be prepared to adapt my approach as more information becomes available, and be open to changing my testing strategy as needed.


Document and keep track of the progress: I would document my testing efforts and track my progress to ensure that I am on track to meet the project's objectives. This would help me identify any issues that need to be addressed and ensure that the project is moving in the right direction.


Communicate with stakeholders: I would keep stakeholders informed of the progress of the project, and any issues or risks that arise. This would help ensure that stakeholders are aware of what is happening and that they are able to make informed decisions.


# What is your approach to selecting elements in Selenium?


Inspect the element: I would first inspect the element on the web page using browser developer tools to obtain the unique properties of the element such as the id, class, name, or xpath.


Choose the best locator strategy: I would then choose the most appropriate locator strategy based on the unique properties of the element, the stability of the locator, and the performance of the test.


Use the most stable and unique locator: I would prefer using the id or name attribute as a locator if they are unique and stable.


Use class or CSS selectors with caution: I would use class or CSS selectors with caution as they can be affected by changes in the web page's layout.


Use xpath only if necessary: I would use xpath only if no other locator strategy works and if the element is not present in the HTML DOM.


Avoid using the index: I would avoid using the index when selecting elements as it can lead to flaky tests and unexpected results.


Use explicit waits: I would use explicit waits to ensure that the elements are loaded and available before interacting with them.


Avoid hardcoding the locators: I would avoid hardcoding the locators in the test scripts and instead store them in a separate file or class to make the test more maintainable.


Validate the selected element: I would validate that the selected element is indeed the correct one by interacting with it or checking its properties.


In summary, my approach would be to select elements by using the most stable and unique locator, avoiding hardcoding the locators, validating the selected elements and using explicit waits when necessary. This approach would help ensure that the tests are reliable, maintainable and efficient.
