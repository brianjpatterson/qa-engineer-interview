# In your experience what are different challenges QA faces on a regular / day to day basis?


Keeping up with fast-paced development cycles: In a fast-moving environment, it can be challenging to keep up with the rapid pace of development and ensure that software is thoroughly tested and ready for release.


Managing competing priorities: A QA engineer may have to balance multiple projects or priorities at once, which can be challenging to manage and ensure that everything is being tested properly.


Dealing with changing requirements: As software development progresses, requirements may change, which can make it difficult for a QA engineer to stay on top of what needs to be tested and how.


Finding and reproducing bugs: Finding and reproducing bugs can be challenging, especially if they are not easily reproducible or if they are intermittent in nature.


Keeping up with new technologies and tools: New technologies and tools are constantly emerging, and it can be difficult for a QA engineer to stay current and know how to use them effectively.


Managing and organizing test cases: Keeping test cases organized and up-to-date is crucial for effective software testing, but it can be a time-consuming task.


Defining and maintaining test automation: Automating tests can save a lot of time and improve the efficiency of the testing process, but it can be challenging to define test automation that can handle the variety of test cases, and maintain them as the product evolves.


Collaboration with other teams: A QA engineer may need to work closely with other teams such as development, product, and customer support. Ensuring effective communication and collaboration can be challenging.


# In your experience, have you ever had to manage multiple teams at the same time?


Yes, I have had experience managing multiple teams in my previous role as a software QA engineer. It required clear communication and coordination to ensure that each team was aware of the objectives and priorities of the project, and that their work aligned with these goals. I had to balance the needs and resources of each team effectively, and I had to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team. I also provided regular updates and feedback to ensure that all teams were aware of the progress and status of the project. I had to rely on my strong leadership and management skills as well as effective communication and conflict resolution skills to manage multiple teams successfully.


# What is your approach when you have found a bug in the software product?


Reproduce the bug: I would first reproduce the bug to ensure that it can be consistently replicated and to gather any additional information that may be needed to understand the bug.


Document the bug: I would then document the bug in a clear and concise manner, including information such as the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. I would also include any relevant screenshots, log files, or error messages.


Assess the severity of the bug: I would assess the severity of the bug and determine the priority level based on how it impacts the functionality of the software. This would help to determine when the bug should be fixed and how it should be prioritized.


Communicate the bug to the development team: I would communicate the bug to the development team as soon as possible, providing them with all of the relevant information and documentation. This would help them understand the issue and begin working on a fix.


Track the bug: I would track the bug throughout the entire process, from the initial report to the final resolution. This would involve keeping track of the status, progress, and any additional information that may be needed to resolve the bug.


Validate the bug fix: Once the development team has fixed the bug, I would validate the bug fix to ensure that it has been resolved and that the software is functioning as expected.


Update the documentation: If necessary, I would update the documentation to reflect the bug and its resolution.


Communicate the resolution to the stakeholders: I would communicate the resolution of the bug to the stakeholders, including the development team, the project manager, and any other relevant parties.


Overall, my approach would be to ensure that the bug is thoroughly documented, communicated promptly, and tracked until it is resolved and validated. I will also make sure that the stakeholders are informed about the bug resolution and the impact it has on the software.



# What are different qualities that a software QA engineer should have in order for them to be successful in a very fast moving environment?


Strong attention to detail: They should be able to spot even the smallest bugs or errors in the software.


Good communication skills: They should be able to clearly communicate any issues or concerns to the development team.


Flexibility and adaptability: They should be able to adjust to changes in requirements or timelines quickly and efficiently.


Strong problem-solving skills: They should be able to think critically and come up with effective solutions to any problems that arise.


Technical expertise: They should have a good understanding of the software development process and be familiar with industry-standard tools and technologies.


Proactivity and initiative: They should be able to identify and address potential issues before they become problems.


Strong team player: They should be able to work well with other team members and collaborate effectively to deliver high-quality software.



# Can you tell me the difference between an implicit and explicit wait?


In software QA engineering, an implicit wait and an explicit wait are both used to handle dynamic elements on a web page, but they differ in how they are implemented and used.


An implicit wait is a setting that is applied globally to the entire WebDriver instance. When an implicit wait is set, the WebDriver will wait for a certain amount of time (in seconds) before timing out when trying to find an element on the page. This wait time applies to all elements, and will be used whenever the WebDriver is searching for an element. The implicit wait is set once and lasts for the entire duration of the WebDriver's execution.


On the other hand, an explicit wait is used to wait for a specific element or condition to be met before proceeding with the execution of the script. The explicit wait is set on a per-element basis and is used in conjunction with expected conditions, which are predefined conditions that the WebDriver should wait for before proceeding. The explicit wait is set only when the specific element or condition is needed, and will only wait for that specific element or condition.


In general, an implicit wait is used when you expect an element to be present within a certain amount of time and an explicit wait is used when you want to wait for a specific element or condition on the page before proceeding with the execution of the script.



# How do you approach working in an ambiguous environment?


Understand the scope of the project and its objectives: I would first try to understand the high-level goals of the project and what the end-result is supposed to be. This would help me get a sense of what needs to be achieved and what the expectations are.


Gather requirements: I would then work on gathering as much information as possible about the project. I would reach out to stakeholders, developers, and other team members to understand the requirements, constraints, and any other factors that could impact the project.


Identify key areas of uncertainty: Once I have a good understanding of the project, I would try to identify the key areas where there is ambiguity or uncertainty. This could include things like requirements that are not fully defined, unclear acceptance criteria, or areas of the application that are yet to be built.


Prioritize testing efforts: I would then prioritize my testing efforts based on the areas of uncertainty. I would focus on testing the most critical and uncertain parts of the application first.


Communicate and collaborate with team members: In an ambiguous environment, communication and collaboration are key. I would make sure that I am regularly communicating with the other members of the team and working with them to resolve any issues or questions that arise.


Be adaptable and flexible: I would be prepared to adapt my approach as more information becomes available, and be open to changing my testing strategy as needed.


Document and keep track of the progress: I would document my testing efforts and track my progress to ensure that I am on track to meet the project's objectives. This would help me identify any issues that need to be addressed and ensure that the project is moving in the right direction.


Communicate with stakeholders: I would keep stakeholders informed of the progress of the project, and any issues or risks that arise. This would help ensure that stakeholders are aware of what is happening and that they are able to make informed decisions.


# What is your approach to selecting elements in Selenium?


Inspect the element: I would first inspect the element on the web page using browser developer tools to obtain the unique properties of the element such as the id, class, name, or xpath.


Choose the best locator strategy: I would then choose the most appropriate locator strategy based on the unique properties of the element, the stability of the locator, and the performance of the test.


Use the most stable and unique locator: I would prefer using the id or name attribute as a locator if they are unique and stable.


Use class or CSS selectors with caution: I would use class or CSS selectors with caution as they can be affected by changes in the web page's layout.


Use xpath only if necessary: I would use xpath only if no other locator strategy works and if the element is not present in the HTML DOM.


Avoid using the index: I would avoid using the index when selecting elements as it can lead to flaky tests and unexpected results.


Use explicit waits: I would use explicit waits to ensure that the elements are loaded and available before interacting with them.


Avoid hardcoding the locators: I would avoid hardcoding the locators in the test scripts and instead store them in a separate file or class to make the test more maintainable.


Validate the selected element: I would validate that the selected element is indeed the correct one by interacting with it or checking its properties.


In summary, my approach would be to select elements by using the most stable and unique locator, avoiding hardcoding the locators, validating the selected elements and using explicit waits when necessary. This approach would help ensure that the tests are reliable, maintainable and efficient.


# How do you decide what should be automated and what you are not going to automate at all?  What are the criteria for automation in order for you to  spend the time you are going to spend to automate a feature?


As a software QA engineer, there are several factors to consider when deciding what should be automated and what should not be automated:


Repeatability: Automation is particularly useful for tasks that are repetitive and need to be performed multiple times. If a task needs to be performed frequently, it may be more efficient to automate it.


Stability: Automation is also useful for tasks that are stable and unlikely to change. If a feature or functionality is unlikely to change, it may be a good candidate for automation.


Time-consuming: Automation can be used to save time on tasks that are time-consuming or that would take a long time to perform manually.
Risk: Automation can be used to reduce the risk of human error on tasks that are prone to errors.


Cost-benefit: It's important to weigh the cost of creating and maintaining the automation against the potential benefits. It may not make sense to automate a task if the cost of automation is greater than the benefits gained from it.


Test coverage: Consider what type of testing the automation will cover. Some types of test such as exploratory testing, usability testing and acceptance testing are not suitable for automation.


Return on investment: Consider the return on investment of the automation. Automating a test that runs once a year is not worth the time and effort put into it.


Complexity: Automation is not suitable for complex tasks that require human intelligence and decision making.


In general, it's important to consider the cost and benefits of automation and to prioritize the tasks that will provide the most value. It's also important to consider the maintainability and scalability of the automation in the long run.


# Can you explain your automation test framework as-is, right now?  Why is it built this way, as it is?  What’s the framework, how does all of this come together?

As a software QA engineer with 5 years of experience, I have experience building automation test frameworks for various projects. The framework that I have built is based on the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and is built using Selenium WebDriver, Java and TestNG. The POM pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and scalable. It also allows for easy modification of the tests without affecting the other parts of the framework.


The framework consists of several components:


A base class that sets up the WebDriver, and provides methods for interacting with the web page.


Page classes that represent the pages of the web application and contain the locators and methods for interacting with the elements on the page.


Test classes that contain the test cases and use the methods provided by the page classes to interact with the web page.


TestNG annotations are used to define the test flow, set up the test environment, and execute the tests.


Maven is used as a build tool and also for managing dependencies.


I also have implemented a reporting library like Extent report for test results reporting.


The framework is designed in a way that it can be easily integrated with CI/CD pipeline and can be easily scaled to accommodate more tests and test suites. I have chosen Selenium and Java for this framework as it is widely adopted in the industry for automating web application testing and it provides a wide range of functionalities and supports multiple programming languages. The use of POM pattern and TestNG annotations makes it easy to maintain and scale the code.


# How much do you know about CI/CD and do you have experience building automation tests into the pipeline?


I am familiar with the concepts of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) and have experience building automation tests into the pipeline. I understand the importance of automating the testing process and integrating it with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the software is tested and deployed quickly and efficiently, without compromising on quality. I have experience setting up and configuring CI/CD pipelines using tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI. Additionally, I have experience with various test automation frameworks such as Selenium, Appium, etc. to build and run test suites as part of the CI/CD pipeline.



# Have you ever used BDD


Yes, I have experience using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) in my previous role as a QA automation engineer. I have experience creating and implementing test cases using Gherkin syntax and utilizing BDD frameworks such as Cucumber and SpecFlow.



# What is your favorite software and why?  What are different quality aspects of that software that you like?   Have you observed anythingyou would like that particular software to improve?


One of my favorite software tools is Selenium WebDriver. I find it to be a powerful tool that offers a wide range of functionalities and supports multiple programming languages. It allows for automating web application testing, which is essential for ensuring the quality of the software. Selenium's ability to interact with the web page elements and its support for different browsers make it a versatile tool for testing web applications. The Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and its integration with TestNG make it easy to write maintainable and scalable test code. Additionally, Selenium's wide adoption in the industry makes it easy to find support and resources for troubleshooting and learning.

While Selenium is a powerful tool, there are a few areas where it could be improved. One such area is its support for testing dynamic web pages that rely on JavaScript and AJAX. Selenium's support for JavaScript is limited and it may require additional libraries and frameworks to handle such scenarios. Another area of improvement is the speed and performance of running Selenium tests. Running a large number of tests can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, and it can be challenging to run Selenium tests in parallel.


Additionally, Selenium does not have a built-in reporting feature, so you need to use external libraries for generating test reports. Some libraries like ExtentReports or Allure are popular among QA engineers but it would be great if Selenium could have a built-in reporting feature to make it more convenient for developers.


Finally, As Selenium WebDriver is just a tool for automating browser interactions, it does not have built-in support for other test types like load testing, performance testing and security testing. So, it would be great if Selenium could include support for other types of testing to make it a more versatile tool.
